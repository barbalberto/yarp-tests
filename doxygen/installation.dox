\section installing_rtf Installing RTF

If you have not installed RTF, Please see http://robotology.github.io/robot-testing/index.html . 
Note that `yarp-tests` use the YARP support in RTF, so please check that RTF is compiled with the `ENABLE_MIDDLEWARE_PLUGINS` CMake option setted to ON. You should also make sure that the yarpmanager
plugin generated by RTF can be found by the testrunner. For more info on how to install RTF with
YARP support, please check the [YARP support documentation on RTF](https://github.com/robotology/robot-testing/blob/master/doc/yarp_configuration.md) .

\section building_tests Building tests 

On Linux machines, open a terminal and type:
~~~
    $ git clone https://github.com/robotology/yarp-tests.git
    $ cd yarp-tests;
    $ mkdir build; cd build
    $ cmake ../; make
~~~

On windows machines use the CMake program to create Visual Studio project and build it. 

Note: in case CMake fails to detect the RTF package check that you installed RTF or that you set the RTF_DIR environment variables to point to the build directory. Also check that RTF was compiled with YARP support enables (set `ENABLE_MIDDLEWARE_PLUGINS` and verify that `ENABLE_YARP` is ON).

\section soncifugration Configuration

* Test cases are built as RTF plug-ins (shared libraries) and can be found in `icub-tests/build/plugins` folder. We need to add the plug-ins path to the platform library environment variable (i.e., `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` on Linux machine). 

~~~
    $ echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<path to yarp_tests/build/plugins>' >> ~/.bashrc
~~~

* Tests configuration (.ini files) can be found in `icub-tests/suit/contexts`. We need to configure `YARP_DATA_DIRS` environment variable so that the test cases can load the configuration files.

~~~
    $ echo 'export YARP_DATA_DIRS=$YARP_DATA_DIRS:<path to yarp-tests/suits>' >> ~/.bashrc
~~~
